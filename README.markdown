PHP Extensions Made Eldritch: Code Samples
------------------------------------------

The code in this repository accompanies the PHP Extensions Made Eldritch tutorial, available at:

* [Installing PHP](http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/blog/2011/08/11/php-extensions-made-eldrich-installing-php/)
* [Hello, World!](http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/blog/2011/08/11/php-extensions-made-eldrich-hello-world/)
* [PHP Variables](http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/blog/2011/08/11/php-extensions-made-eldrich-php-variables/)
* [Classes](http://www.snailinaturtleneck.com/blog/2011/08/11/php-extensions-made-eldrich-classes/)

If you don't want to copy/paste all of the code, you can clone this repo and check out sections as you go.

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/kchodorow/rlyeh.git
</pre>

Part 2 of the tutorial (Hello, world!) is on the master branch.  Stating in part 3, each "unit" has a <b>branch: &lt;branchname&gt;</b> at the beginning.  You can checkout this branch if you want to see the code example in context.

For example, if you see <b>branch: oop</b>, you'd do:

<pre>
$ git checkout -b oop origin/oop
</pre>

Then you can compare what you're doing to the example.
